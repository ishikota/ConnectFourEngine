1. Main program
  - execute genetic algorithm.
  - you should write parameter for your problem in another file. program reads it and start GA process.
  - parameter format is fomulated.(see below).
2. Algorithm
  - you use these 3 basic GA process [selection, crossover,
    mutation] in main program.
  - some algorithm needs to be set parameters. What parameter does algorithm
    needs is written in its head of the file.
3. Test
  - test program to check how GA working.
